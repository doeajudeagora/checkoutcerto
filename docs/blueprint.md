# **App Name**: Checkout Clone

## Core Features:

- UI Cloning: Replicate the checkout page's UI based on the provided screenshots, focusing on layout, colors, and element placement.
- Input Field Handling: Implement input fields for collecting necessary checkout information, such as address, credit card details, and contact information. Add proper input validation and error messaging.
- Total Cost Display: Dynamically calculate and display the total cost, considering factors like discounts and shipping fees. It also allows to change the shipping and billing details during checkout. The application implements server side requests, therefore a payment gateway isn't necessarily required to fulfill the application main goal.
- Generative UI Refinement: An AI tool to suggests layout adjustments based on UI/UX best practices, improving the user experience based on the current design and user interactions during testing.
- Order Submission Simulation: Simulate the submission of the order, displaying a confirmation message without actual payment processing.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA) to give a calm and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#ADD8E6) for buttons and active states, offering subtle contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif providing a modern and neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, geometric icons for clarity. The icon set must match the overall aesthetic (neutral color palette, square-ish). Avoid rounded corners.
- Maintain a clean, organized layout with consistent spacing. Use a grid system to align elements precisely, following the layout presented in the checkout screenshots.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for feedback on interactions (e.g., button hover states, loading indicators), without distracting from the main checkout flow.
